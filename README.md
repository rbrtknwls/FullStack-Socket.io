# Full Stack Practice!
Here's a library of a bunch of projects I made that I am using to learn more about dev ops and full stack development!
These projects won't be very good... as I am merely using them as a way to learn about message passing between servers.

## Running my trash!
List of things you need to run each project:
```
cd (/directory name)
```
Go to the project that you want to run.
```
npm install --save express socket.io
```
Installs our express and socket.io dependencies.
```
npm start
```
Runs the project!
